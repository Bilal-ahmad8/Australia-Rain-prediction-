# Australia-Rain-prediction-
This my first ML project. The dataset is taken from Kaggle, it contains data for past 10 years. Major problem in dataset contains too much missing values, these values has been imputed with different strategies according to the % of missing values and distribution of variables.
Notebook and Dataset is also provided 


**Data Source**

Dataset is taken from Kaggle, which contains Australia rain dataset for past 10 year(2007-2017) 

**Installation instructions**

You can download the dataset and notebook from my repository and can implement on your jupyter notebook by uploading notebook on your Jupyter IDE
and then run codes(shift+Enter).

**Result and evaluation**

Started the project by importing some basic libraries. Loading data and basic EDA to know data. Afterward preprocessed the data, major problem in dataset contains too much missing values, these values has been imputed with different strategies according to the % of missing values and distribution of variables. Then modelling and evaluating the model performance.
